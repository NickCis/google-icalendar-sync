# Google ICalendar Sync

The idea of the project is to provide a endpoint to export an ical formatted output of a private calendar.

Normally, you would use the default [_Private Address_](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37648?hl=en), but, if your admin has not allow that sharing option you won't see it.
This project provides the same functionallity but, as it uses the google api, you always can create the link.
